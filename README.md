# Simon Game

## HTML Structure

- Contains a heading with instructions and a container for the game buttons.
- Four buttons are displayed in a 2x2 grid layout, each representing a different color (green, red, yellow, blue).

## CSS Styling

- The page has a dark blue background with centered text.
- The title is styled with a retro font and a yellow color.
- The game buttons are styled with distinct colors, a border, and rounded corners.
- A `.pressed` class is used for a visual effect when buttons are clicked.
- A `.game-over` class changes the background color to red on game over.

## JavaScript Functionality

### Button Colors

- An array of button colors (`buttonColors`) defines the four game buttons.

### Game Patterns

- `gamePattern` stores the sequence of colors generated by the game.
- `userClickedPattern` records the user's input sequence.

### Game State

- `level` tracks the current game level.
- `started` is a boolean indicating whether the game has started.

### Functions

- `music(color)`: Plays a sound corresponding to the given color.
- `nextSequence()`: Increments the level, generates a new color in the sequence, and animates the corresponding button.
- `animate(currentButton)`: Adds a visual effect to the button when clicked.
- `checkAnswer(currentLevel)`: Checks if the user input matches the game sequence; if correct, it proceeds to the next level, otherwise, it triggers a game over.
- `gameOver()`: Plays a "wrong" sound and changes the background to indicate game over.
- `startOver()`: Resets the game state to start over.

## User Interaction

- The game starts when a key is pressed, initializing the game sequence.
- Users click the colored buttons in the correct sequence to progress to higher levels.
- A wrong sequence triggers a game-over state, prompting the user to restart.
